# Hi there, I'm Enes! 👋

### 💻 Software Engineering Student | Problem Solver

I am a Software Engineering student focused on **mastering the core logic of programming** rather than just memorizing syntax. I enjoy breaking down complex problems and building intuitive, responsive web applications. 

My current focus is on crafting seamless front-end experiences, but I am actively mapping out my journey to become a versatile, multi-disciplinary developer.

### 🛠️ Current Tech Stack
These are the technologies I currently use to build dynamic and responsive web applications:

* **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, C++
* **Libraries & Frameworks:** React.js, Bootstrap 5
* **Tools:** GitHub, VS Code

### 🚀 Future Roadmap & Learning Goals
I believe engineering is a continuous learning process. Here is what I am planning to explore and master next:
- **Backend Development:** To understand server-side logic and database architecture.
- **Mobile App Development:** To bring my web concepts into the hands of mobile users.
- **Automation:** To write scripts that optimize workflows and eliminate repetitive tasks.
